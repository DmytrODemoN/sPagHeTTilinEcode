One Line Spaghetti Code for robot_dreams.

I took on Task 2:
Create a one-line code that collects all the lost socks from the laundry, that is, finds the unique elements in the array and sorts them.

The programming language is JavaScript. And in total, I got 35 words, 551 characters, of which 321 were spaces.

Any JavaScipt compiler can be used to execute the code.
